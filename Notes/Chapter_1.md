# 1.1 The Fundamentals of Agile Software Development

Agile testers work differently from those in traditional projects. They must understand Agile values and principles, and collaborate closely with developers and business representatives. Early and frequent communication helps eliminate defects early and deliver high-quality products.

## 1.1.1 Agile Software Development and the Agile Manifesto

In 2001, the Agile Manifesto was created, establishing four core values:

- Individuals and interactions *over* processes and tools  
- Working software *over* comprehensive documentation  
- Customer collaboration *over* contract negotiation  
- Responding to change *over* following a plan  

Although the items on the right have value, Agile values those on the left more.

### Key Concepts Behind Each Value

1. **Individuals and Interactions**: Emphasizes communication and collaboration over reliance on tools.  
2. **Working Software**: Prioritizes delivering usable functionality early, allowing quick feedback and faster time-to-market.  
3. **Customer Collaboration**: Close, continuous interaction with customers improves requirement clarity and project outcomes.  
4. **Responding to Change**: Agile embraces change rather than resisting it, allowing adaptation to external factors like business shifts or technological advances.

### Agile Principles

The Agile Manifesto is supported by twelve guiding principles:

1. Deliver valuable software early and continuously.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.
3. Deliver working software frequently (weeks to months).
4. Business and developers must work together daily.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals with proper support.
6. Face-to-face communication is the most effective method.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Promote sustainable development at a constant pace.
9. Maintain technical excellence and good design.
10. Simplicity is essential—maximize work not done.
11. Self-organizing teams produce best architectures, requirements, and designs.
12. Teams regularly reflect and improve their effectiveness.

Agile methodologies apply these values and principles through specific practices.

## 1.1.2 Whole-Team Approach

The whole-team approach involves everyone  with the knowledge and skills necessary for project success, including testers, developers, and business stakeholders. Teams are ideally small (3–9 people) and co-located to improve communication.

Daily stand-ups help identify progress and impediments.

### Benefits of the Whole-Team Approach

- Enhances collaboration and communication.
- Leverages diverse skill sets across the team to benefit the project.
- Assigns responsibility for quality to the entire team.

Testers actively participate in all stages, including:

- Supporting business stakeholders in defining acceptance tests.
- Collaborating with developers on testing strategy.
- Contributing to decisions on test automation.

All team members, including testers, are involved in feature discussions, estimates, and decisions. This practice is known as the **"power of three"**, involving testers, developers, and business representatives working closely together, the quality level is a shared responsibility.

## 1.1.3 Early and Frequent Feedback

Agile projects use short iterations to enable early and continuous feedback on product quality throughout the development lifecycle. One way to provide rapid feedback is by continuous integration.

Unlike sequential development where customers only see the final product, Agile teams collect regular feedback throughout development. This enables early adjustments, helps prioritize high-value features, and improves transparency by showing sprint capacity and velocity improvements. 

For example, how much work can we do in a sprint or iteration? What could help us go faster? What is preventing us from doing so?

### Benefits of Early and Frequent Feedback

1. Helps avoid misunderstandings in requirements by identifying issues earlier.
2. Allows early clarification and delivery of requested features to the customer.
3. Enables early detection and resolution of quality issues through continuous integration.
4. Provides transparency into team performance and delivery capacity.
5. Supports better planning and adjustments to improve team velocity.
6. Maintains consistent momentum throughout the project.

Frequent feedback ensures that high-value and high-risk features are prioritized and delivered first, improving customer satisfaction and reducing rework.
